- Added the TPS Detector, a block that outputs the TPS and MSPT of the server as a redstone signal.
- Slight changes to spinny command block animation, it'll now spin faster the closer it is to a restart.
  - It should also be a little smoother.
- Added a new command, `/restartdetector`, with a few subcommands to use the mod even without hijacking the vanilla stop command.
